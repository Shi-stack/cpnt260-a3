***Information about Client:*** I have created this page so in future I can merge this page in my final presentation website. 

I am sure if plan can change at the end :)

***Goal:*** Created a gallery with 12 large size images. Given picture credit (PC) and one line description. I have wrapped figure in div intially but in validator was giving error cannot wrap figure in div.. So finally figured it out how to write it.

Writing Grid was challenging and try to make a design giving every image grid column and grid row but to make that reponsive may be i have to use media query. ***PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF ANY ALTERNATIV IS THERE***. coz auto fill and auto fit was not working for design. Again I am not sure I was scared experimenting a lot. Put notes in my CSS file.

***Asset:***

Tony helps me lot in indenting and organizing. I know i havent done in perfect way, but trying to be.
